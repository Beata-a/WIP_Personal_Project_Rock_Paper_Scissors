# WIP_Personal_Project_Rock_Paper_Scissors
I have started making my own version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors as a personal project. I will soon be learning about functions and will intend to go back to this code and improve upon it!

Aside from introducing functions, I need to add comments!
I also want to have different message displayed when someone doesn't play any games, and then decides to exit.
I believe I can make one with a simple variable where I add 1 every time a game is played.
